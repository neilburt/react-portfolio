      <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I live in North Minneapolis with my girlfriend and cat companion. We have a beautiful house in the Victory neighborhood near Robbinsdale. I'm a gamer who loves to camp and go on walks. I love animals, am really into birding, and have always enjoyed dabbling with computers and tech.

      I worked in retail for 13 years, the final three in management, primarily with stock and inventory control before deciding to move on. I made a natural transition to more warehouse work but in manufacturing instead and after a few years in that field, I decided it was time to make a change. Thus began my journey into the world of Coding.
